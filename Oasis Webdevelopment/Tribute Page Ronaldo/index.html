        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
          Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro, born on February 5, 1985, in
          Funchal, Madeira, Portugal, grew up in the parish of Santo António.
          The youngest of four children, he was raised in a humble household by
          his mother, Maria Dolores, a cook and cleaning woman, and his father,
          José Dinis, a municipal gardener and part-time kit man for Andorinha
          football club. Ronaldo's great-grandmother on his father's side was
          from Cape Verde. Named after Ronald Reagan, Ronaldo faced challenges,
          including his mother's initial intention to abort him due to poverty
          and his father's alcoholism.
        </p>
        <h2>Football Journey</h2>
        <p>
          He began his football journey with Andorinha and Nacional before
          joining Sporting CP's youth system at age 12. By 14, he focused solely
          on football, quitting school despite struggles and an expulsion
          incident. Diagnosed with tachycardia at 15, he underwent successful
          heart surgery and continued his career. Ronaldo idolized Brazilian
          footballers Ronaldinho and Ronaldo Nazário, who influenced his passion
          for the sport. His mother later remarked that without football,
          Ronaldo might have become a bricklayer.

            philanthropic efforts, including donations to hospitals and
            children's charities. Off the field, he is a successful entrepreneur
